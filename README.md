Store app
=======
This is a little store application created according to the steps given in the RailsCast on Minitest.  The purpose
behind this was to explore implementing Minitest and learning how to write tests in Minitest instead of RSpec or
Unit::Test.

Setup
=======
Once you've copied down the repo and are running it (rails s), you will need to go straight to the products page
at http://localhost:3000/products, since the root path only brings up the default rails app page.
